# Deploy

This chapter provides information about how to deploy the cms api.

There are two methods for deployment of this cms:

- [Docker](./docker.md)
- Directly from code (without docker, not implmented currently) 

With docker you can go step by step from this documentation to deploy with docker and nginx.
